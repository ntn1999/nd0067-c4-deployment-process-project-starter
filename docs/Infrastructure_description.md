# Infrastructure Description

This document outlines the infrastructure needs for hosting the API, Frontend, and the DB for our application. We will be using Amazon Web Services (AWS) for our infrastructure needs. The infrastructure includes the following AWS services:

    Amazon RDS (Relational Database Service)
    Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service)
    Amazon Elastic Beanstalk

# Amazon RDS

Amazon RDS will be used to host our relational database. RDS is a fully managed service that provides scalable and highly available relational databases in the cloud. We have chosen RDS because it simplifies database management tasks, such as patching, backups, and scaling. RDS also provides high availability and fault tolerance through multi-AZ deployments.
# Amazon S3

Amazon S3 will be used to store static assets, such as images and videos. S3 is an object storage service that provides industry-leading scalability, data availability, security, and performance. We have chosen S3 because it can store and retrieve any amount of data from anywhere on the web. S3 also provides advanced security and compliance capabilities, such as encryption, access control, and audit logs.
# Amazon Elastic Beanstalk

Amazon Elastic Beanstalk will be used to host our API and Frontend. Elastic Beanstalk is an easy-to-use service for deploying and scaling web applications and services. We have chosen Elastic Beanstalk because it provides a platform that is preconfigured with the software stack and resources needed to run our application. Elastic Beanstalk also simplifies deployment and scaling by handling the underlying infrastructure provisioning, load balancing, and auto-scaling.
# Infrastructure Diagram

The following diagram shows the different AWS services used for hosting the API, Frontend, and the DB.

             | (Object Storage)|
             +-----------------+

In this diagram, the Frontend and Backend are hosted on Elastic Beanstalk, which provides auto-scaling and load balancing capabilities. The Backend is connected to Amazon RDS for database storage. Static assets, such as images and videos, are stored in Amazon S3.
# Conclusion

In summary, we will be using Amazon Web Services to host our API, Frontend, and the DB. We have chosen Amazon RDS for hosting our relational database, Amazon S3 for storing static assets, and Amazon Elastic Beanstalk for hosting our API and Frontend. This infrastructure will provide us with scalability, high availability, and fault tolerance needed for our application.
